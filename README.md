# IoT-Based Smart Dustbin
# Overview
This project aims to develop a smart dustbin that autonomously separates dry and wet waste using a moisture sensor. The device leverages IoT technology to provide an efficient and eco-friendly solution for waste management.

# Components
Microcontroller: [Specify the microcontroller used, e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi]
Moisture Sensor: Detects the moisture content of the waste.
Servo Motor: Controls the opening and closing of the respective bins for dry and wet waste.
Power Supply: Provides power to the components.
Wi-Fi Module: Enables wireless communication and data transmission.
Housing: Encloses the electronic components and waste bins.

# Working Principle
Waste Detection: When waste is deposited, the moisture sensor detects its moisture content.
Waste Separation: Based on the moisture level, the servo motor directs the waste to the appropriate bin (dry or wet).
Data Transmission: The microcontroller transmits real-time data on waste levels and separation status to a remote server or mobile app.
Potential Applications
Smart Cities: Efficient waste management in urban areas.
Residential Areas: Automated waste segregation at home.
Commercial Establishments: Improved waste management in offices, restaurants, and hotels.
Future Enhancements
Real-time Monitoring: Implement a mobile app to monitor waste levels and receive notifications.
Waste Classification: Explore advanced sensor technologies to classify waste into multiple categories.
Solar Power Integration: Utilize solar energy to power the device, reducing reliance on external power sources.
Waste Weight Measurement: Incorporate a weight sensor to track the amount of waste collected.
